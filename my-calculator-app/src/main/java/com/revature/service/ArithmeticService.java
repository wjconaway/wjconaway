// The service layer is responsible for the processing of data. We would perform business logic inside of the service layer.
// Ex. imagine you are developing the backend for facebook. The service layer of Facebook's backend would contain business logic related to providing friend
// recommendations, ad recommendations, etc. for a particular Facebook user.
// All sorts of complex algorithms could be developed, and those would ultimately be part of this "service" layer.
// Sometimes, the service layer will be pretty simple (especially for CRUD applications)
// CRUD = Create, Read, Update, Delete
// CRUD applications are applications that are primarily designed to keep records of data
