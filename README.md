  Hello my name is Willie Conaway and I am currently working as a Software Development Engineer in Test at Revature.  A little about my background is I was born 
in Jacksonville FL, but I grew up in Valdosta, GA a small city in South Georgia and graduating from Valdosta High School.  After graduating high school, I join 
the Navy where I served 11 years and did 3 tours while there including being part of the first Strike Group of Operation Enduring Freedom. 

  After leaving the Navy I went to College in VA attending ECPI University receiving a BS in Electronic Engineering Technology.  Shortly after graduating college, I 
decided to go in the Air Force Reserves where I served another 8 years but decided to get out due injuries, I endured from my time in the Navy getting worse. 
This also led me to make a career change looking for something less physical, but productive and fun in which I decided to be a Software Engineer. 

  A little Fun Fact about me is I am one of the lowest rank members of the Navy to ever perform a Reenlistment Ceramony, reenlisting another sailor, 
I was an E5 at the time and this something that is done by officers and Sr. enlisted personnel. I was also one of the lowest rank supervisors on 
an Aircraft Carrier, I was an E4 at the time and supervisors are usually E6 and sometime E5 on an Aircraft Carrier an E4 supervisor is pretty much 
unheard of there and it wasn't due lack of personnel.
