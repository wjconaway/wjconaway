  1% is all it takes because if you can improve yourself 1% each day you are on the road to truly becoming an amazing person and the best part about it is it's never too late to start. The human brain, unlike a hard drive, never runs out of storage so there is no limit on what we can achieve.  

  Hello my name is Willie Conaway and I am currently working as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) at Revature. As a SDET I use technologies and tools such as Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber and Maven to automate and test Java programs, but I am more than a SDET, Im also a Dad, a military veteran, and a person who gets alone with anyone.  

  A little about my background. I was born in Jacksonville FL, but I grew up in Valdosta, GA which is a small city in South Georgia, graduating from Valdosta High School home of the Wildcats, research them you will be amazed. After graduating high school, I join the Navy where I served 11 years as a Interior Communications Electrician and working my up to a 1st Class Petty Officer (E6) before leaving.  While serving, I were station on the 2 different Aircraft Carriers, the USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Harry S. Truman doing a total of  3 deployments (tours) in the Middle East, including being part of the first Strike Group of Operation Enduring Freedom. 

  After leaving the Navy I went to College in VA attending ECPI University receiving a BS in Electronic Engineering Technology.  Shortly after graduating college, I 
decided to go in the Air Force Reserves where I served another 8 years but decided to get out due injuries, I endured from my time in the Navy, getting worse. 
This also, along with the pandemic, led me to make a career change looking for something less physical and flexible, but productive and fun in which I decided to be a Software Engineer. 

  A little Fun Fact about me is I am one of the lowest ranking members of the modern Navy to ever perform a Reenlistment Ceramony, reenlisting junior sailor, 
I was an E5 at the time and this is something that is done by officers and Sr. enlisted personnel. I was also one of the lowest ranking supervisors on 
an Aircraft Carrier, I was an E4 at the time and supervisors are usually ranked E6 and sometimes E5 on smaller ships, but on an Aircraft Carrier an E4 supervisor is pretty much 
unheard of and it wasn't due lack of personnel.
